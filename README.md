# Description

Javascript (ljs) is the GENERIC language of browser-javascript (ljb, client-side) and Node-javascript (ljn, server-side) and other differentiations.  
Javascript was originally developed in {1995} by Brendan-Eich, at Netscape-Communications-Corporation. [en.wikipedia.org] 

My goal here is my text to be MONOSEMANTIC as possible, in contrast to existing texts, by defining most of the-names of my sentences.   
ALSO, my text differs than the traditional one.   
I publish STRUCTURED-CONCEPTS|ModelConceptStructureds (with attributes also concepts) in contrast to traditional text, that describes concepts. 

This is a living concept (= an evolving concept), see and reference by version.   
Version last.minor is dynamic (do not reference with it), all others are static.   
Even though the-work I have-put on this webpage-concept is NOT a small amount, much more is needed.
